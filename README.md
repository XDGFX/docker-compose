# XDGFX / docker-compose
This is my custom docker-compose. Feel free to use bit from it, or copy the whole thing. Some containers might not work straight off the bat - i.e. guacamole.

## Credentials
All credentials are stored separately in `.env`

The folder structure is

```
docker/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
├── traefik/
├── shared/
└── ... etc
```
